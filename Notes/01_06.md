able to call a class method with a string using;

```python
getattr(obj, string)()
```

the above code translates to 
obj.string().

implemented a couple of user actions. 

current problem with code below:

```python
    def completedTask(self):
        taskName = input('taskName: ')
        self.todo.task_completed(taskName)
```

does not save to file, pretty sure the problem is with the template I have created when the json data is stored before updating the json file.

There was a spelling error with the key value implemented in python and key method implemented in json.

Also had to convert the type of datetime object into a string.

An interface may make using the program easier, than just using the terminal.
