The Design of the program is very flawed, However it does function. I believe as new features are implemented and old features updated, the ugly code and design will end up getting slimmed down.

I'd like to start working on forming the relationships between Tasks. I'd like to use an undirected graph, where there are two classes of Nodes;
The first class of Nodes, would be the root Nodes, these will be represent the Tags.
The second class of Node would be the actual task.
Each edge, will be connected to the task and the root tag.

The visual would be similar to a visual representation of a network.

The visual network representation, will be alot more difficult to represent than I initially thought...

The star_graph with a spring_layout, seems to fit the look I want

where the 0-node, would be the TagName. The children nodes will be the TaskNames that have been tagged with the root name.
