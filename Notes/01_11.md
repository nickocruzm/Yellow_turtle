I decided to make a GUI for the program. At first I wasn't very concerned with the GUI, but as I was watching coding Explained, a Netflix show. They spoke about the GUI and how it allows users (with no background in computer science) to use programs, and at the end of the day. There really seems to be 0 purpose in producing a program that isnt meant to be used by others, or help others in their everyday lives, and if a great program is out there to help someone with something in their lives, but the user has a certain overhead to just access the application which prevents them from using that program, then that program essentially lost a 'customer' a 'user' which is truly the purpose of a developer, in creating it in the first place.
