## CURRENT PROBLEM (4:03 pm)

- calling a function through user input.
- previously I was able to do this through the use of

```python

func = globals()[usr_input]
func()

```

The above code would use the user input as a key to call the function. However, two things have changed.

1) Ive seperated functionality between objects, making the functions no longer in the global scope.
2) The methods i've implemented are defined to take in arguments that are passed in by the program itself, not the user.
