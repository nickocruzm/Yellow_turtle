    - Task object is being implemented. 
    - I need to commit to a design pattern to plan out how I will decoded and encode
the Task object. 
    - Need a design pattern to use in general, for the entire program.
    - Currently main.py file is the functioning file that I am using. Although functional, it is not in a
state that will allow me to conduct analysis on the data collectted.
