    + get it to look pretty, COMPLETED [x]
        SOLUTION: print(json.dumps(data,indent=4))

    - does not display newly added data


Update
    - Figure out how to access each item in the json file, without knowing the the keys name.
    I need to updata a dictionary within a dictionary.  jf


Future updates

    - for each task's dictionary, to allow for easier access.
        
        time:[
            'created':
            'remaining':
            'complete':
        ]
